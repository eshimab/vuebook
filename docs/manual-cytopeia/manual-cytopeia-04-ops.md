::: note Summary
This chapter contains detailed step-by-step instructions for operators new to the instrument. Information on use of the software is included.
:::

### 4.1 Preparation

#### 4.1.1 Collect Supplies

1.  Gather and clean all supplies:
    1.  Sheath and waste reservoirs
    1.  Nozzle tip
    1.  Nozzle back-flush reservoir (spoon)
    1.  Sample tubes
    1.  Cotton swabs
    1.  Paper towels
    1.  Microscope slides

#### 4.1.2 Prepare Fluidics Reservoirs

1.  Fill the sheath tank with up to 6 liters of sheath fluid, preferably filtered at 0.2um.
1.  Ensure the Waste Reservoir is clean and empty.
1.  Attach lids and quick connect fittings from instrument fluidics lines to the reservoirs.
    1.  Note that each port is unique. Each fitting connects to only one port.

### 4.2 Power-up

#### 4.2.1 Power up Fluidics

##### Start Fluidics Early

1.  Fluids take from 30-60 minutes to fully stabilize. It is therefore important to start the fluidics as early as possible.

##### Close Valves

1.  Ensure all the valves are closed:
    1.  Sample Valve
    1.  Sheath Valve
    1.  Purge Valve
    1.  Sample Pressure Valve

##### Pressurize Sheath Reservoir

1.  Close the pressure relief valve on the sheath reservoir.
1.  Turn on air supply by flipping up the AIR toggle switch on the Pressure Console.
1.  Observe the gauge on the sheath reservoir to ensure that it is being pressurized.
    1.  Reseat the lid of the Sheath Res if the pressure on the Sheath Res does not increase.

##### Apply Vacuum

1.  Turn on the vacuum pump or other vacuum supply.
1.  Read the gauge of the waste reservoir and ensure that it reads at least 5” Hg. If less than 5” Hg is observed after the tank has a few moments to come to pressure, tighten the lid.
    1.  It is necessary for the waste reservoir lid to be tightened as much as possible without the use of a wrench.

#### 4.2.2 Start Lasers

1.  Most lasers require at least 30 minutes of warm-up time.
1.  Close all laser shutters on the instrument and start all lasers in accordance with the manufacturer’s procedures.
1.  Typical Laser Control Units have key switches to prevent unauthorized or unintended use.
1.  Power output of the laser may be set to the desired level, or the laser put into standby mode.

#### Start Computer

1.  Turn on the computer.

### 4.3 Stream Generation

#### 4.3.1 Flush System

1.  Place the flush bucket under the nozzle.
1.  Recheck that the waste reservoir has an adequate level of vacuum applied to it.
1.  Open the Purge Valve and then the Sheath Valve.
1.  Run sheath fluid through the lines for approx 2min.
1.  Ensure that lines are free of air bubbles.
1.  Close the Purge and Sheath valves.

#### 4.3.2 Clean and Attach Nozzle Tip

1.  Get the nozzle tip.
1.  Clean Nozzle tip.
    1.  Sonicate nozzle tip for approx 5 minutes.
    1.  Fill a 60ml syringe with filtered water (De-ionized distilled MilliQ SheathSolution etc).
    1.  Attach a 0.1um filter to the tip of the syringe.
    1.  Place the nozzle (tip up) on the edge of the outflow of the 0.1um filter.
    1.  Flush with clean water. Don't worry about keeping it wet or drying it out.
1.  Install the nozzle tip.
    1.  Using tweezers where necessary to avoid contaminating the nozzle tip.
    1.  Snug an O-ring of PN-645263 in the channel at the inside-bottom of the nozzle nut.
    1.  Hold the nozzle nut aloft. Insert the nozzle, tip down, so that the O-ring seals to the sloped sides of the nozzle tip, and the nozzle protrudes from the bottom of the nozzle nut.
    1.  Gently snug the nozzle tip and O-ring to even out pressure on the O-ring.
    1.  Screw the nozzle nut onto the threads at the tip of the nozzle assembly. Using only your fingers, tighten the nozzle nut onto the assembly as tightly as you can. Never use wrenches or other tools to install the nozzle nut.
        1.  Be gentle starting off. If you feel any sort of resistance, it may be that the base of the nozzle tip is pressing against the rim of the pipe the nut is being attached to.
        1.  Carefully back the nut off, and attempt to re-straighten the nozzle tip within the nozzle nut to attempt another installation. Remember to keep the nozzle tip clean of contamination.

#### 4.3.3 Start a Stream

1.  Open the Sheath Valve to start a stream.

#### 4.3.4 Backflush and Debubble

1.  Backflush the sample line by opening the SAMPLE VALVE.
1.  Close the SAMPLE VALVE after the sample line drips sheath fluid for about 30 seconds.
1.  Close the SAMPLE VALVE after backflushing.
1.  Purge the nozzle of bubbles by placing the clean nozzle purge reservoir filled with sheath fluid atop the flush bucket.
    1.  This allows sheath fluid to be pulled up into the nozzle.
1.  Ensure that the nozzle tip is submerged into filtered sheath fluid in the nozzle purge reservoir.
1.  Close both the SAMPLE VALVE and the SHEATH VALVE, then open up the purge-valve.
1.  When the purge-valve is opened, bubbles (in the nozzle assembly) should be observed as they are pulled up through the nozzle.
1.  When all bubbles have traveled past the purge-valve, open the sheath-valve and then close the purge-valve. If necessary, add sheath fluid to the nozzle backflush reservoir to keep the tip submerged throughout this process.
1.  Remove the nozzle backflush reservoir and use a cotton swab or similar to remove excess fluid from the nozzle tip.
1.  Ensure that stream is emitted straight out of the nozzle tip.
    1.  If the stream is even slightly askew, return to the top of this subsection and repeat cleaning of the nozzle and flushing the system.
1.  Ensure that there are no bubbles in the system by closing the SHEATH VALVE.
    1.  If there are no bubbles, the stream should snap off quickly (less than one second).
    1.  If there are bubbles, the stream will take more time to stop (10-30sec).
        1.  This will require repeating this subsection.
1.  After testing for bubbles, reopen the SHEATH VALVE.


#### 4.3.5 Align Stream

1.   Ensure that a corning tube is set in the well platform beneath the stream drain in the sort channel.
2.   **WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR SOFTWARE**

##### img "WDU Tray in PRESENT Position"

1.   Remove the flush bucket so that the stream passes through the illumination chamber into the sort chamber.
2.   Flip the ILLUM switch on the Control Panel to ON to illuminate the stream near the drain.
3.   The stream may or may not land in the stream drain but should be captured by the corning tube if it misses the stream drain.
     1.   If not, take extra precautions to ensure the stream is contained.
4.   Alignment of the stream consists of:
     1.   Bringing the stream into the focal point of the microscope objective.
     2.   Use the pinhole monitor and the sort stream nibutir for ordinary visual feedback while making adjustments to the stream.

1.   **(1) Bringing the stream into focus**
     1.   Use the x-axis (focus), y-axis (left-right), and z-axis (up-down) micrometers of the nozzle stage to focus and position the stream in the pinhole monitor as shown below.
     2.   The stream should be centered in the pinholes, sharply focused, and the nozzle tip should be barely visible at the top of the monitor.
     3.   It may be helpful to use the halogen lamp to illuminate the stream in the laser chamber for this procedure.
2.   **(2) Position Stream**
     1.   Once the stream is properly focused in the pinhole monitor, use the theta-angle and phi-angle micrometers of the nozzle stage to aim the stream at the drain in the sort stream monitor.
3.   Iterate between **(1)** and **(2)** until the stream is focused and positioned in the pinhole monitor and also aimed at the drain in the sort stream monitor.
4.   

##### img: "Right: Stream Focused in Pinhole Camera. Left: Stream Aimed at drain"

### 4.4 Droplet Formation

1.   Droplet formation is achieved by using a piezoelectric element to focus an acoustic wave into the stream at the nozzle tip.
2.   The stream may need to run about 10 minutes before droplet formation will become stable.
3.   

#### 4.4.1 Turn on the piezoelectric

1.   Flip up the PIEZO switch on the Control Panel.
2.   Rotate the PIEZO knob to an appropriate amplitude setting.
     1.   Typically, this setting is approximately 4 for Standard Sort flow and 6 for High-Speed Sort flow.
     2.   If the amplitude is too high, the waveform of the jet will interfere with the forward scatter signal.
     3.   If the amplitude is too low, the Break-Off Point (BOP) will be unstable.
3.   Fine-tuning of the piezo amplitude will be completed later when optimizing the BOP.
4.   (Ken note) *"This switch is a locking switch: Pull out then flip up"*

#### 4.4.2 View the Break-Off Point (BOP)

1.   Adjust the micrometer of the drop camera so that the BOP can be seen in the drop monitor.
2.   (Ken Note) *"Drop position indicates micrometer position"*
3.   (Ken Note) *"Drop Position should be about 200, and piezo should be about one. 6 drops should be visible on the monitor"*
4.   (Ken Note) *"For Counting, we want this set lower than for sorting"*

##### img: Drop camera image Ken Note *"Drop Position = 200"*

#### 4.4.3 Close and turn on PLATES

1.   Swing the Deflection plates into their closed position.

##### img Deflection Plate and Thumbscrew

1.   Close the Sort Cavity Door and switch on the high voltage plates by flipping the PLATES switch on the control panel up.
2.   Note that a red LED on the control panel will illuminate to indicate the plates are on.

#### 4.4.4 Turn on *STREAM DEFLECTION*

1.   Flip up the STREAM DEFLECTION switch on the control panel.
2.   Set the stream deflection amplitude knob to about 1/4 of its full range for now.

#### 4.4.5 Optimize Break Off Point (BOP)

1.   Creating test sort streams and tuning the piezo amplitude to optimize the BOP.

1.   Create left and right test sort streams by flipping up the TEST LEFT and TEST RIGHT switches on the control panel.
2.   Sort streams should now be visible in the sort stream monitor.
3.   Use the deflection amplitude knob to adjust the sort streams so that they clear the drain as shown below.

##### img: Sort stream image with side streams

1.   Flip up the $$1-1\frac{1}{2}$$ switch on the control front panel.
2.   Adjust the PIEZO AMPLITUDE knob until the sort streams are maximally deflected.
3.   Use the drop monitor to note that the piezo amplitude can be increased or decreased until the next or previous drop is deflected.
4.   Once the desired drop is optimally deflected, carefully note the appearance of the droplet formation at the BOP.
5.   It is crucial that the droplet waveform remains constant while sorting.
6.   It is sometimes necessary to adjust the PIEZO AMPLITUDE while sorting to keep the waveform of the jet at the BOP constant.
7.   Flip off TEST LEFT, TEST RIGHT, and 1-11/2.

#### 4.4.6 Set STREAM DEFLECTION amplitude

1.   The proper setting of deflection amplitude results in a sort stream that falls into the center of a sort tube during 2-way sorting.
2.   (Ken Notes) *"With 1-1/2 switches up, you need to see four deflections to maximize deflection distance"*
3.   (Ken Notes) *"Otherwise, should only have two deflections. Adjust piezo so that only two are outside"*
4.   (Ken Notes) *"System must be warmed up and the drop rate not changing"*
5.   (Ken Notes) *"STREAM FOCUS: Adjust knob to take the fuzziness off center stream."*
6.   (Ken Notes) *"FUZZINESS INDICATES CHARGE LEAKAGE"*
7.   (Ken Notes) *"ONLY ADJUST STREAM FOCUS WHEN 1-1/2 BUTTON IS IN THE OFF POSITION"*

1.   Place a tube in the left receptacle of the WDU (Well Deposition Unit) insert.
2.   Place a microscope slide over the tube.
3.   Spigot Steps
     1.   In tray screen, send WDU to the 2-tube sort ready position.
     2.   Quickly flip up and down the TEST LEFT switch on the control panel to put a small droplet of water on the slide.
     3.   Send the WDU to 2-Tube -> 2 Tube.
4.   Remove the WDU insert and check the slide to see if the droplet would have landed in the center of a collection tube.
5.   If 96-well sorting is desired, follow a similar procedure except use a 96 well tray insert and the 96-well sort mode for the WDU mode.


###  4.5 Illumination

1.  Illumination consists of steering the laser paths so that they intersect the stream at proper locations.
2.  The following steps should be repeated for each illumination laser.


#### 4.5.1 Open Laser Shutter

1.  Close the laser chamber door slide and put the chamber lid in place.
2.  Open the manual laser shutter on the left side of the sort head.

##### img: Manual laser shutter in open position

1.  The instrument is also equipped with an automatic laser shutter interlock system.
2.  When the system is armed, opening the chamber door slide will cause the automatic shutter to close.
3.  It will not reopen unless two conditions are met:
    1.  The chamber door slide is closed.
    2.  The system is reset by placing a finger in front of the reset detector.
4.  The reset detector is behind a small hole in the upper right corner of the chamber door, as shown below.

##### img: Laser Interlock system reset aperture

::: warning ALWAYS USE EYE PROTECTION
1.  The laser interlock system does NOT eliminate the need for operators to wear eye protection.
2.  It is possible that a bright light pointed at the chamber area will cause the laser shutter to be opened even though the chamber door slide is open.
:::


#### 4.5.2 Steer laser to stream

1.  Note:
    1.  Most lasers will show a glow in the pinhole monitor when they strike the stream.
    2.  All lasers will scatter off the stream and create a horizontal laser scatter line across the chamber and the chamber door window.
    3.  This procedure can be more challenging with UV lasers due to their invisibility.
    4.  Fine-tuning of the laser will be completed later, when running calibration files.

1.  For each laser:
    1.  Use the illumination stage's y-axis (sweep) and z-axis to aim the laser at both the center of the stream and at the height of the appropriate pinhole.
    2.  Adjust the y-axis micrometer of the nozzle stage so that the forward and side scatter intensities are maximized.
    3.  Adjust the z-axis micrometer so that the appropriate pinhole is illuminated.
    4.  Again, this is an interactive process.
    5.  The laser will not need to be focused except for special applications.
    6.  For information on laser focus, see chapter 5.
    7.  Repeat for each laser.


### 4.6 Sample Introduction


#### 4.6.1 Load Sample Tube

1.  Use only Falcon 35-2063 5mL sample tubes.
2.  Cytopie recommends all samples be filtered to 40um to prevent nozzle clogs.

1.  Fill tube with up to 3 mL of sample.
2.  Load tube into sample tube holder and lock the tube in place over the stopper using the lever.
3.  Take care not to damage the sample tube.

##### img: Locking sample tube in place

::: warn
1.  Use care when removing the sample tube.
2.  The sample tube is usually pressurized and may spill or splatter.
3.  To properly remove the sample tube:
4.  Move the lever slowly backward until the tube is pushed down into the recessed area of the lever.
5.  Pressure is then released, and the tube may be removed safely.
:::


#### 4.6.2 Open SAMPLE VALVE

1.  Check that the sample pressure is set about 1 PSI over the sheath pressure.
2.  Open the SAMPLE VALVE.

#### 4.6.3 Run sample at a low rate

1.  Aim the laser so that it is just above the center pinhole, in between pinholes for multi-laser systems.
2.  When running bright calibration beads or cells at a low flow rate, a narrow sample core can be viewed in the pinhole monitor.
3.  If the flow rate is too high, the sample core will be very large, approaching the size of the jet.
4.  If no beads are observed flashing in the stream, then the flow rate is too low.
5.  (Ken Note) *"We use spheriotech ultra rainbow beads at one drop to one ml sheath (approx).*

##### img: Pinhole camera image, with beads showing in stream

1.  The flow rate of the sample is determined by the sample pressure setting.
2.  A sample pressure of 1 PSI over sheath pressure at low flow rate is usually achieved; however, this setting depends on the concentration of the sample.
3.  When first running a sample, you may wish to BOOST the sample pressure temporarily in order to get sample to the jet quickly.
4.  Hold down the BOOST button to boost the sample to 3 PSI over the sheath.
5.  Adjust sample pressure until a low flow rate is achieved.
6.  Iterate between these steps until the sample core is as narrow and bright as possible:
    1.  Adjust the y-axis of the illumination stage so that the brightest signal is observed in the pinhole monitor.
    8.  Adjust the x-axis of the nozzle stage so that the signal is tightened (spatially) in the pinhole monitor.
7.  Use the z- and y-axes of the nozzle stage to place the sample core in the center of the pinhole.
8.  The SAMPLE VALVE may be closed if desired at this point to preserve the sample until data acquisition parameters are set up.

### 4.7 Data Acquisition

1.  Spigot software is used for most all data acquisition controls.
2.  Spigot allows control of PMTS and allows custom gating schemes to be developed and saved in configuration files.
3.  It is recommended that a configuration file be saved for each protocol run on the inFlux.
4.  See the chapter on the Spigot Interface for detailed descriptions of the spigot functions.
5.  This chapter will refer to fluorescence channels as FL1-FL7 and forward and side scatter as FSC and SSC.

#### 4.7.1 Open a Spigot Configuration File (*.sco)

1.  If a spigot configuration file has already been saved for alignment particles, open that file and skip the steps outlined below for configuring Spigot.
2.  Otherwise, follow the directions below and set up a new configuration and save the settings in a new *.sco file by selecting FILE > SAVE CONFIGURATION FILE in Spigot.

#### 4.7.2 Activate PMTs

1.  Activate all PMTs that will be used during alignment.
2.  It is crucial that the FSC PMT is activated since it is the signal that is used for the system trigger.
    1.  No data will be acquired unless the FSC PMT is activated.

#### 4.7.3 Choose parameters to plot

1.  Choose parameters to plot in Spigot's Left display as described in the Spigot Interface chapter.
2.  Typically FL1 is plotted vs FSC and these instructions will detail how to set-up and align those two parameters.
3.  Use a similar method for plotting other or more parameters.

#### 4.7.4 Set initial PMT gains

1.  The inFlux system is shipped pre-configured for linear (lin) or logarithmic (log) amplification for fluorescent channels.
2.  These settings can be changed on the Patch Panel on the front of the electronics console.
3.  Spigot can also be set to either log or lin for any channel as a visual reminder of the controlling hardware setting and to display logarithmic scales on data plots.
4.  As PMT gains are increased, the system will begin to acquire pulse data.
5.  The oscilloscope is used to monitor the pulses and is very useful for setting initial PMT gains.
6.  From Spigot's Simple Config screen, set the [Scope Display] > [CH1 and CH2] displays to FSC and FL1 (usually channels 1 and 3).
7.  Use Spigot to increase the FSC gain until pulses of about 5V can be detected on the oscilloscope.
8.  Do the same for FL1.
9.  Since the range for pulse height measurements in Spigot is 0-10 V, pulse heights of about 5V should correspond to data that is acquired in about the middle of a FL1 vs FSC plot in the left display.
10. Make sure that data are being acquired by Spigot and adjust the PMT gains so that the data are not off-scale.

#### 4.7.5 Set trigger level and event trigger delay

1.  [Trigger Level] sets the threshold for the lowest detectable signals and is set off the system trigger (usually FSC).
2.  Its intended use is to eliminate noise.
3.  It is best to keep the [Trigger Level] as low as possible since the system will not detect any events that fall below the threshold, and those events may end up in the sorted sample.
4.  With multi-laser systems, it is necessary to set the Event Delay for each additional laser.
5.  Align additional lasers using the pinhole monitor and the oscilloscope.
6.  Adjust the event delay from the menu until the signals from the additional lasers fall into appropriate bins as displayed on the third oscilloscope trace (labeled as the ALL cable).
7.  Finally, make sure that additional laser channels are set to the appropriate levels (1, 2, or 3) in the [SIMPLE CONFIG] screen. Typically, [EVENT DELAY] will only need to be changed if the sheath pressure of the system is changed.



### 4.8 Alignment

1.  Fine-tuning of the inFlux involves positioning the sample core at the focal point of the objective lens in the pinhole, illuminating the sample core optimally, and aligning the FSC.
2.  PMT gains may need to be adjusted as the system is to keep data on scale.

#### 4.8.1 Focus light emission from the sample in the stream

1.  Open sample valve and ensure that the sample flow is flowing at a low rate.
2.  As described earlier in this chapter, ensure that the sample core is:
    1.  focused
    2.  maximally illuminated
    3.  in the center of the pinhole using:
        1.  the pinhole monitor
        2.  Nozzle Stages
        3.  Illumination Stage

#### 4.8.2 Optimize Fluorescence Channel

1.  While a FSC signal must be detected first (if it is the system trigger), it is important to first align to a FL or SSC channel since the objective lens is fixed while the FSC detector stage allows adjustment.
2.  Some flow cytometer operators prefer to align the FL signals using linear amplification.
    1.  To do so, move the BNC connector on the front of the electronics console from LOG to LIN for the appropriate channel.
    2.  Remember to set the channel back to LOG after tuning and use Spigot to re-adjust the PMT gain appropriately.
3.  Adjust the y-axis of the illumination stage and use the oscilloscope pulse monitor and the left Spigot screen to maximize the signals from the FL1 detector.
4.  The pulse should be as high as possible and the signal in Spigot should be maximized.
5.  Remember to ignore the FSC signal while tuning the FL channel.

#### 4.8.3 Optimize forward scatter signal

1.  Once the FL signal is optimized, the FSC signal can be optimized.
2.  Use the y- and z-axes of the forward scatter stage to maximize the signal from the FSC detector.

#### 4.8.4 Optimize additional laser paths

1.  After the first laser path is aligned for fluorescence and FSDC, additional laser paths can be aligned for fluorescence using their respective illumination stages as described in this section.

### 4.9 Sort Gating

1.  Sort gates can be defined via the Spigot interface.
2.  Up to 12 (6 left and 6 right) 2-parameter sort windows can be defined at the same time.
3.  Sort windows are two-dimensional sort gates that allow the operator to select portions of data to be sorted.
4.  Many options, such as sort filtering, are available.
5.  These instructions will describe how to set up a basic sort window as well as a few advanced features.
6.  The Spigot Interface chapter also contains reference information.

#### 4.9.1 Draw Sort Windows in Spigot

1.  To draw a sort window (SW) in Spigot, first click on the SORT.
2.  The right display will contain six squares corresponding to the instrument's six Look-up Tables ("LUTs").
3.  Highlight LUT 1 by clicking inside the square of LUT 1.
4.  The border around LUT 1 will turn orange, indicating that LUT 1 is selected for editing.
5.  Choose the parameters for the SW (i.e., FL1 vs FSC) by changing the X and Y axes selection on the left display.
6.  The LUT will inherit the axes of the left display's plot when axes are changed.

1.  In the left toolbar's sort window function area, choose whether the gate will be a left SW, right SW, or both by clicking left, right, or both.
2.  To draw a rectangular or elliptical SW, click on Rectangle or Ellipse, and left-click and drag on the left display.
3.  To draw a SW of any shape (polygon), single left click again and continue the process until the desired shape is drawn.
4.  Right-click to close the polygon and finish drawing the SW.
5.  Once the SW is drawn on the left display, it will also appear in the LUT on the Right Display if Show Sort Windows is checked in the right toolbar.
6.  Data that have a left SW drawn around them will become red.
7.  Data that are selected for both right and left sorting will become yellow and will not be sorted.

1.  Additional LUTs can now be selected, and different parameters may be selected for SW drawing. For example, LUT 2 may be chosen to display FL2 vs SSC.
2.  By drawing another SW around these new parameters, it is possible to detect a particle with four desirable characteristics:
    1.  e.g., FSC FL1 FL2 FL3
        1.  It may fluoresce green.
        2.  Have particle forward and perpendicular scatter values and not fluoresce red.

1.  In this fashion, up to 12 parameters can be set for both right and left sorting (depending on the number of photomultiplier tubes included in the particular inFlux configuration).
2.  SWs follow "and" logic; as additional SWs are created in multiple LUTs, only data selected in *all* SWs will be sorted.
3.  Data that are selected for the left or right sorting in *all* SWs will appear green (left sort) or red (right sort) in the Left Display.

4.  An operator may also choose data outside of a SW to be sorted again by selecting the LUT in the Right Display, drawing a SW in the left display, and clicking on Left or Right and clicking Outside in the left toolbar.
5.  This allows for "not" logic to be used when multiple SWs are drawn in multiple LUTs.

1.  Overall sort statistics are displayed on the left display, while individual statistics for each LUT are displayed next to each LUT.
2.  LUT statistics report the percentage of particles chosen for left sort, right sort, neither, or percentage of particles selected for left, right, neither, or both sort when SWs have been drawn in multiple LUTs.

1.  The Reset button (in the sort window function area) can be used to reset SWs drawn in a particular LUT window by selecting the LUT and clicking on Reset.
2.  All LUT SWs can be reset by clicking the Reset All button in the sort window function area.
3.  SWs may be moved or stretched by clicking on the modify button.

#### 4.9.2 LUT/Classifier Filters

1.  Spigot allows data filtering based on SWs for easy identification of populations and subpopulations across many parameters.
2.  Two types of filtering are possible: LUT filtering and classifier filtering.
3.  When LUT filters are activated, the left display will only show data that are inside SWs drawn in the LUTs.
4.  LUT SWs can be filtered through in any combination, alone, or not at all.
5.  When a classifier filter is selected, the left display will only display data that have been selected for sorting in *all* LUT displays (i.e., the actual data to be sorted).

1.  To apply a LUT filter, click on SHOW LUT FILTERS.
2.  A small rectangle of six boxes will appear in the left display. These six squares represent the 6 LUTs and by clicking on one of the squares, the data will be filtered through any SW drawn in that particular LUT.
3.  Multiple LUTs can be filtered through in combination by clicking on more of the squares.

1.  Classifier filters can be applied by changing the left toolbar's drop-down menu selection from No Classifier Filter to the desired classifier filter setting.

### 4.10 Analyzing

1.  Once the system is tuned, data may be analyzed.
2.  Spigot provides real-time analytical tools described in the Spigot interface chapter.
3.  For detailed statistical analysis, Spigot allows data to be stored in the *.fcs file format that can be read and manipulated with separate analysis software such as FlowJo.

#### 4.10.1 Save *.fcs files

1.  To save data to an *.fcs file from Spigot, refer to LIST TOOL and QUICK LIST sections in the Spigot Interface chapter.



### 4.11 Drop Delay

1.  Setting the proper drop delay is critical for sort purity and recovery.
2.  When the same nozzle tip and sheath pressure are used each day, the delay setting will be very similar day to day, and thus some of the following steps may not be necessary.
3.  The following instructions describe how to find the proper delay setting without knowing the previous day's settings.

1.  It is very important that the fluid stream has had at least 30 minutes of warm-up time to stabilize. It is also very important that there are no bubbles in the nozzle.
2.  Refer to the Stream Generation section to make sure that the nozzle is properly purged of bubbles.

#### 4.11.1 Optimize Droplet Formation

1.  Re-optimizing the BOP as described in the above section on Droplet Formation.
2.  

1.  Use the PIEZO AMPLITUDE knob to ensure that the waveform of the jet at the BOP remains constant through the delay calibration process.
2.  Minor adjustments to the PIEZO AMPLITUDE knob are normal.
3.  If a major adjustment is necessary, then check to make sure that there are no bubbles or clogs in the nozzle.

#### 4.11.2 Use Spigot to approximate Drop Delay

1.  Open the SORT DELAY screen in Spigot.
2.  Scan the drop camera to the points indicated, using the bottom edge of the drop monitor as a reference point.
3.  Enter the value of the DROP POSITION (indicated on the pressure console) for each position.

##### img: Drop Position readout on Pressure Console

1.  Enter the master clock frequency in Hz and click Calculate.

##### img: Clock setting (KHz) on function generator

1.  Spigot will calculate the approximate drop delay.
2.  Click Set Drop Delay in Spigot to set the system drop delay to the calculated value.

#### 4.11.3 Run test series with the WDU

1.  Run calibration particles at a low rate (100-1000/sec) and draw a SW around them as described in the Sort Gating Section.
2.  From the TRAY screen in Spigot, send the WDU to Calibration > Present.
3.  Place a microscope slide in the WDU and insert it in the first position.
4.  Send the WDU to Calibration > Sort Ready.
5.  Open the SORT screen in Spigot and choose the number of particles to be sorted for the calibration run.
6.  It is recommended (and these instructions will assume) that the sort count be set to 20.
7.  Open the TRAY screen in Spigot and click Sort! The WDU will place a 5x5 matrix of puddles on the slide.
8.  Each puddle on the slide represents a sort command for the set number of particles (20) at different delay settings.
9.  After the WDU deposits the 225 puddles, a screen will pop up that lists the delay setting Spigot used for each of the 25 puddles.
10. Take the slide to a fluorescent microscope and count the number of particles in each puddle.
11. A Drop Delay Worksheet is provided in the appendix of this manual as a suggested method for keeping track of the particle counts per puddle.
12. Identify the three puddles in series with the highest particle counts.
13. Take note of the position of the middle puddle of the series of 3 with the highest count.
14. Read the delay value from the Spigot delay setting popup that corresponds to the puddle indicated above.
15. This will be the delay setting used for the next calibration run.

#### 4.11.4 Set Drop Delay

1.  To set the drop delay to the value indicated by the delay setting popup, open the SIMPLE CONFIG screen in Spigot and change the delay setting as required.

#### 4.11.5 Repeat Delay Calibration

1.  Repeat the above steps until two calibration series in a row yield the same value for the delay.
2.  This will be the delay setting used for the rest of the day.
3.  Remember that sheath pressure, master clock setting, and BOP all need to remain constant in order for this delay setting to be accurate.
4.  If any of those settings change, the delay will need to be reset as described above.

### 4.12 Sort Modes

1.  When sorting, it is important to consider both coincident particles and the position of particles inside droplets.
2.  Coincidence occurs when two or more particles are closer than the spacing of the droplets, so that more than one particle ends up in the droplet.
3.  Obviously, these droplets must not be sorted in order to achieve maximum purity.
3.  Coincidence is higher when sample rates are higher and when droplet rates are lower; thus, choosing a proper sort mode depends on those settings and the desired result of the sort: Purity or Recovery.
4.  When the exact count of a sort is important, such as when sorting one particle into each of 96 wells, it is important to consider the position of the particle inside the droplet since particles near the droplet boundaries may end up in either droplet.

#### 4.12.1 inFlux Systems

1.  The inFlux sorter provides circuitry to take care of these issues.
2.  Coincidence circuitry allows the user to set a coincidence window (in the number of drops) before or after an event is detected.
3.  If another particle is detected within the coincidence window, the particles will not be sorted.
4.  A 1-1/2 drop sort mode is also available.
5.  The 1-1/2 drop sort mode will sort two drops when a particle is on a droplet boundary and one particle when a droplet is in the center of a drop, ensuring accurate sort count.
6.  Cytopeia recommends three different combinations of these two settings to arrive at useful sort modes depending on the desired outcome of the operator.
7.  Other settings may be experimented with as desired.

#### 4.12.2 Setting 1: High throughput, high purity, low recovery (<85%)

1.  Use this setting when sample rates are high compared to droplet rates, and when the count of the sorted particles is less important.
2.  Pre and Post Coincidence = 3/4 drop, 1 drop sort

#### 4.12.3 Setting 2: Low Throughput, High Purity, Higher Recovery (<95%)

1.  Use this setting when sample rates are low compared to droplet rates, and when the count of the sorted particles is important.
2.  Pre and Post Coincidence = 1-1/4 drop 1-1/2 drop sort

#### 4.12.4 Setting 3: Highest Recovery, Lower Purity

1.  Use this setting when high recovery is desired and purity is not as important.
2.  Pre and Post Coincidence = Disable Coincidence, 1-1/2 drop sort

#### 4.12.4 How to set the coincidence and sort mode

1.  The 1 -- 1-1/2 switch on the control panel switches the sort mode from 1-drop (switch down) to 1.5-drop (switch up) while sorting.
2.  Note that the same switch is also used to fine-tune the phase of the SOP as described in the droplet formation section above.
3.  The function is unrelated to the sort mode function and is only intended to be used for setup, and not for sorting.
4.  Coincidence settings can be changed in the CONFIGURE ADCs menu in Spigot.
5.  Do not set the coincidence higher than 1-1/4 drop.

### 4.13 Sample Collection

1.  The WDU feature allows samples to be collected into 5ml sample tubes and 96-well plates.
2.  Additional collection trays can be developed for special configurations.
3.  Make sure that the system is aligned, droplet formation is stable, and that the delay setting has been calibrated before collecting sample.

#### 4.13.1 Running Samples

1.  When running samples, it is critical that the sample line be back-flushed for about 30 seconds with switching to new samples to minimize sample carryover.
2.  If sample carryover is a major concern, load a sample tube with sheath fluid and run clean water through the sample line at high sample pressure (~5 PSI above sheath pressure) until no particles are detected.
3.  Alternatively, a new sample line can be installed with ease, ensuring no sample carryover.

#### 4.13.2 Left and/or Right Sort

1.  To collect up to two sample populations simultaneously, use the 2-Tube sort mode.
2.  To ensure that the sort streams will fall into the collection tubes, you may wish to double-check the setting of the PIEZO and the STREAM DEFLECTION amplitudes as described in the droplet formation section.
3.  Load two 5ml sample tubes into the WDU insert.
4.  Send the tray to the 2-Tube > SORT READY position.
5.  Make sure that the PLATES are on and that the STREAM DEFLECTION is on.
6.  Choose the number of cells to be sorted left or right from the SORT screen.
7.  Click on Left Sort or Right Sort to begin sorting (based on your gating scheme) into the collection tubes.
8.  A progress bar will pop up in Spigot to give feedback on the number of cells sorted as the sort progresses.

#### 4.13.3 96-Well Tray

1.  96-well Sorting allows a particular number of particles to be placed into each of the wells of a 96 well plate.
2.  Follow directions above but use the 96-Well mode for all tray settings.

#### 4.13.4 Sort Bypass

1.  Selecting Bypass mode in the right toolbar’s sort controls rather than Normal will enable sorting without counting.
2.  As much sorted sample as available in the sample tube will be sorted without count feedback.


### 4.14 Shutting Down

#### 4.14.1 Close Spigot

1.  *No text*

#### 4.14.2 Shut down fluidics

1.  For optimal results and decreased chances of contamination, the inFlux fluidics should be shut down, emptied out, and allowed to dry overnight.
2.  Use the following shutdown procedure:
    1.  Allow the sample line to backflush for at least one minute.
    2.  Close the SHEATH VALVE, SAMPLE VALVE, and PURGE VALVE.
    3.  Turn off the sheath pressure by flipping the AIR switch down on the Pressure Console.
    4.  Empty the sheath reservoir, rinse, and fill with about 200mL of 0.22um filtered distilled or de-ionized (or MilliQ) water.
    5.  Reattach the sheath reservoir (*Ed: Without inline filter I imagine?*), and flip up the AIR switch on the pressure console.
    6.  Reopen the SHEATH, SAMPLE, and PURGE VALVES, let the clean water flow through the system until it has been emptied the sheath reservoir and system blows air.
    7.  Allow the system to blow air until no more water is coming up the sheath line and until no more water drips from the sample line when backflushing.
    8.  Close the SHEATH VALVE, remove the nozzle tip (put nozzle tip in a safe place), place a flush bucket under the nozzle assembly and re-open SHEATH VALVE.
    9.  Let the system blow out for 10-15 minutes to fully dry out the tubing.
    10.  Flip the AIR switch to off on the Pressure Console.
    11.  Remove sheath and waste reservoir and empty all liquids.
    12.  Rinse and/or clean reservoirs as necessary.
    13.  Turn reservoirs upside down on the table on a piece of absorbing tissue.
    14.  Be careful not to damage the gauges or fittings.
