title: 3. Safety
--- 





This chapter:
-   alerts users to known or potential hazards reasonably associated with the inFlux operation
-   outlines safety precautions

::: danger From the Cytopeia manual:
>   Operation of the instrument poses several potential hazards, including hazardous voltage and current, laser radiation, and moving parts. PLEASE read and understand this safety information and this entire manual prior to operating the instrument and follow all safety precautions.
:::

### 3.1 Hazards

-   The following table lists the primary potential hazards that may be encountered during inFlux operation.
-   The instrument is labeled with ANSI/ISO-harmonized safety labels, alerting the user to these potential hazards.
-   The alerting symbols contained in these labels are shown in the table.

| type       | Potential Hazard                  | Symbol |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------- | ------ |
| Electrical | High voltage plates and circuitry |        |
| Light      | Laser Radiation                   |        |
| Light      | UV Radiation                      |        |
| Mechanical | Pinch/crush from Moving Parts     |        |
| Pneumatic  | Tanks and fluidics under pressure |        |
| Heat       | Heated air from instrument        |        |

### 3.2 Safe Operation

#### 3.2.1 General Electric

-   As with all electrical equipment, protect against shock by connecting to an approved grounded power source.
-   Do not, under any circumstances, remove the grounding plug from the power cord.
-   Do not perform any servicing except as specifically stated in this manual.
-   Do not remove any wiring cover or panel with a warning label affixed to it. These covers and panels provide protection against potential electrical shock from components inside.

#### 3.2.2 High Voltage Plates

This instrument requires the use of high voltage plates (HV Plates/Deflection Plates) to deflect desired droplets from the stream for collection. Whenever the plates are in use, the potential for electrical shock exists.

::: danger High Voltage
Do not reach into Workspace (Sort Chamber) while the Deflection Plates are energized! Switch **PLATES** off prior to opening the door and reaching into Workspace (Sort Chamber).
:::

#### 3.2.3 Light Hazards

##### Laser Radiation

This instrument utilizes both Class 2 and Class 3b laser radiation during operation. Follow all laser safety precautions.

::: danger Laser radiation present!
-   Wear suitable eye protection.
-   AVOID DIRECT EXPOSURE TO THE BEAM.
:::

-   For each laser installed with the instrument, follow the laser manufacturer’s operating manual and facility-specific laser safety precautions.
-   For the safety of operators and other persons near the inFlux system during operation, the instrument is equipped with an automatic laser shutter interlock system.
    -   Suitable eye protection must still be worn.
    -   Do not intentionally defeat this system.

##### Ultra Violet Light

#### 3.2.4 Mechanical

Mechanical pinch or crush hazard due to:
-   Do not remove guards or covers with labels alerting to mechanical hazards.
-   Use caution with the sort chamber door hinge.

Well Deposition Unit
-   Moving parts alert.
-   Don’t reach into the “workspace” while the unit is operating.

#### 3.2.5 Pneumatic

Pressurized air and vacuum hazards:
-   Safely connected.
-   Know how to shut off.
-   Use caution near vacuum.

::: warning Pressurized air and fluid lines
The sheath reservoir, sheath lines, and sample lines are pressurized during operation. **Do not operate the instrument at more than 100 PSI.** Use caution when handling Sheath reservoir connections and when relieving reservoir pressure with the pressure relief valve.
:::

#### 3.2.6 Biohazard

::: warning 
Do not introduce any toxic, biohazardous, or other potentially dangerous substances into the instrument.
:::

Responsibility for disregarding this caution rests solely with the owners and operators of the instrument. As with all research-grade equipment:
-   Observe universal biohazard safety precautions and utilize standard laboratory procedures.
-   Operate the instrument only with doors fully closed to guard against aerosols, splashes, and spills.
-   Keep the instrument workspace (sort chamber) and table clean.
-   Do not store liquids on the instrument table.
