**Summary:**

This chapter covers recommended maintenance of the inFlux and provides operators with contact information for customer support at Cytopeia if technical assistance is needed.

### 6.1 Maintenance

#### 6.1.1 Periodic User Cleaning and Inspection

##### 6.1.1.1 Daily

After each day's operation, the fluidics system should be cleared and dried out thoroughly using the following procedure:  
1.  Turn air switch to off.  
2.  Release sheath reservoir pressure, then disconnect, drain, and rinse reservoir.  
3.  Refill sheath reservoir with 100 ml of de-ionized water, reconnect sheath reservoir, and turn air switch on.  
4.  Run this fluid through the entire system, including backflushing the sample line, until the reservoir runs dry.  
5.  Continue to run air through the system for approximately 15 minutes, ensuring that all lines are free of fluids.  
6.  During this time, the nozzle tip may be removed, sonicated if desired, and left to dry in a protected area.  
7.  Shut down fluidics by turning off air switch and vacuum pump.  
8.  Empty, rinse, and air dry both reservoirs.  

##### 6.1.1.2 Weekly

To keep the inFlux running well for a long time, perform the following on at least a weekly basis:  
1.  Remove dust from all exposed surfaces.  
2.  Clean salt buildups from the parts and areas exposed to sheath or sample fluids.  
3.  Clean the WDU tray.  
4.  Vacuum dust and lint from fan areas, such as the back of the sort electronics console, laser power supplies, and the computer.  
5.  Inspect tubing and fluidics for leaks.  

#### 6.1.2 Operator Maintenance

##### 6.1.2.1 Fluidics

1.  The inFlux has been designed so that all fluidics lines are replaceable by the user. 
1.  To order replacement assemblies, and for guidance on installing these parts, please contact Cytopeia Customer Service.
2.  The inFlux system has been tested and validated using specific fluidics tubing.
3.  The use of any tubing other than that provided by or specified by Cytopeia may result in substandard instrument performance, damaging leakage or instrument failure, and will not be supported by Cytopeia.


##### 6.1.2.2 Optics

1.  The inFlux has been designed so that filters in the detector modules may be removed or interchanged by the user.
2.  Any other maintenance should not be considered routine and should only be performed by Cytopeia service technicians.
