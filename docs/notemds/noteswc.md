## Delete ghost files

-   Sometimes iCloud will make ghost copies of files that are named `.filename.iCloud.md` 
    -   This interaction often happens in `iA Writer` 
-   To delete these, change the filename to something without a period, for example `aaa`
-   Then you can delete the newly renamed file in Working Copy.
