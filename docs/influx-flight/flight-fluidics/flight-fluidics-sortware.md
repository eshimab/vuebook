    ::: note Workspace Failed to Load
    Occasionally the Workspace will fail to load. 
    -   The first time this happens, simple click “Okay” and re-open the workspace as before. 
    -   If it fails again, use the Cytometer drop-down menu to ensure that the InFlux is connected via the Dell and Router. 
        -   The Dropdown menu item `Disconnect From Cytometer` should **not** be greyed out
    -   Cytometer not connected? See the previous note on failed connections, or go to Network Troubleshooting.
