## Run Day

::: tip Always check the house air valve first!
-   The InFlux air pressure is provided by an air compressor in C-MORE's attic. 
-   If the building power flickers, the air compressor goes offline. 
-   **Only** UH Facilities have the key to the compressor room. 
-   We are checking the compressor first because, if it is off, the instrument can't be run until UH Facilities restarts the compressor.

::: note asset "House Air Valve"

n the bottom right corner of the bench opposite the instrument.
:::

1. Open the valve on the wall opposite the InFlux Chassis to access the building's air compressor (i.e. House Air).
    1. You should hear a *hiss* as the tubing pressurizes.
    2. If no air flows, then the compressor may be off. This often happens if the building loses power. If the compressor is off:
        1. Call UH Facilities at 1-808-956-7134 and tell them that they need to restart the building compressor at C-MORE.
        2. Tell them that this is impeding work and needs to be done asap.


## Hook-Up Waste Canister

1.  Connect InFlux Waste Lines Intake
2.  Connect Vacuum Pump
    ::: note asset Waste tank / Vac Pump
    The waste tank connected to the vacuum pump.
    :::
    ::: note asset Vac Guard picture
    A properly installed Vacu-Guard filter.
    :::
    ::: warning Always use Vacu-Guard
    1.  Ensure that the vacuum pump to waste tank line has a properly installed Acrodisc Vent filter. 
    2.  The filter text should be on the Waste tank side of the vacuum pump line.
    3.  This filter prevents water from being sucked into the vacuum pump if **you** forget to empty the Waste tank.
    :::
3.  Turn on Vacuum Pump (Pump is powered by InFlux Instrument Power)
4.  Ensure that the House Air is valve is open and pressurized (see Lab Prep)
