# Cytopeia Manual

# 4.1 Preparation

## 4.1.1 Collect Supplies

1.  Gather and clean all supplies:
    1.  Sheath and waste reservoirs
    1.  Nozzle tip
    1.  Nozzle back-flush reservoir (spoon)
    1.  Sample tubes
    1.  Cotton swabs
    1.  Paper towels
    1.  Microscope slides

## 4.1.2 Prepare Fluidics Reservoirs

1.  Fill the sheath tank with up to 6 liters of sheath fluid, preferably filtered at 0.2um.
1.  Ensure the Waste Reservoir is clean and empty.
1.  Attach lids and quick connect fittings from instrument fluidics lines to the reservoirs.
    1.  Note that each port is unique. Each fitting connects to only one port.

# 4.2 Power-up

## 4.2.1 Power up Fluidics

## Start Fluidics Early

1.  Fluids take from 30-60 minutes to fully stabilize. It is therefore important to start the fluidics as early as possible.

### 4.2.1.1 Close Valves

1.  Ensure all the valves are closed:
    1.  Sample Valve
    1.  Sheath Valve
    1.  Purge Valve
    1.  Sample Pressure Valve

## 4.2.1.2 Pressurize Sheath Reservoir

1.  Close the pressure relief valve on the sheath reservoir.
1.  Turn on air supply by flipping up the AIR toggle switch on the Pressure Console.
1.  Observe the gauge on the sheath reservoir to ensure that it is being pressurized.
    1.  Reseat the lid of the Sheath Res if the pressure on the Sheath Res does not increase.

## 4.2.1.3 Apply Vacuum

1.  Turn on the vacuum pump or other vacuum supply.
1.  Read the gauge of the waste reservoir and ensure that it reads at least 5” Hg. If less than 5” Hg is observed after the tank has a few moments to come to pressure, tighten the lid.
    1.  It is necessary for the waste reservoir lid to be tightened as much as possible without the use of a wrench.

## 4.2.2 Start Lasers

1.  Most lasers require at least 30 minutes of warm-up time.
1.  Close all laser shutters on the instrument and start all lasers in accordance with the manufacturer’s procedures.
1.  Typical Laser Control Units have key switches to prevent unauthorized or unintended use.
1.  Power output of the laser may be set to the desired level, or the laser put into standby mode.


# 4.3 Stream Generation

## 4.3.1 Flush System

1.  Place the flush bucket under the nozzle.
1.  Recheck that the waste reservoir has an adequate level of vacuum applied to it.
1.  Open the Purge Valve and then the Sheath Valve.
1.  Run sheath fluid through the lines for approx 2min.
1.  Ensure that lines are free of air bubbles.
1.  Close the Purge and Sheath valves.

## 4.3.2 Clean and Attach Nozzle Tip

1.  Get the nozzle tip.
::: details 1.  Clean Nozzle tip.
    1.  Sonicate nozzle tip for approx 5 minutes.
    1.  Fill a 60ml syringe with filtered water (De-ionized distilled MilliQ SheathSolution etc).
    1.  Attach a 0.1um filter to the tip of the syringe.
    1.  Place the nozzle (tip up) on the edge of the outflow of the 0.1um filter.
    1.  Flush with clean water. Don't worry about keeping it wet or drying it out.
:::

1.  Install the nozzle tip.
    1.  Using tweezers where necessary to avoid contaminating the nozzle tip.
    2.  Snug an O-ring of PN-645263 in the channel at the inside-bottom of the nozzle nut.
    3.  Hold the nozzle nut aloft. Insert the nozzle, tip down, so that the O-ring seals to the sloped sides of the nozzle tip, and the nozzle protrudes from the bottom of the nozzle nut.
    4.  Gently snug the nozzle tip and O-ring to even out pressure on the O-ring.
    5.  Screw the nozzle nut onto the threads at the tip of the nozzle assembly. Using only your fingers, tighten the nozzle nut onto the assembly as tightly as you can. Never use wrenches or other tools to install the nozzle nut.
        1.  Be gentle starting off. If you feel any sort of resistance, it may be that the base of the nozzle tip is pressing against the rim of the pipe the nut is being attached to.
        2.  Carefully back the nut off, and attempt to re-straighten the nozzle tip within the nozzle nut to attempt another installation. Remember to keep the nozzle tip clean of contamination.

## 4.3.3 Start a Stream

1.  Open the Sheath Valve to start a stream.

## 4.3.4 Backflush and Debubble

1.  Backflush the sample line by opening the SAMPLE VALVE.
1.  Close the SAMPLE VALVE after the sample line drips sheath fluid for about 30 seconds.
1.  Close the SAMPLE VALVE after backflushing.
1.  Purge the nozzle of bubbles by placing the clean nozzle purge reservoir filled with sheath fluid atop the flush bucket.
    1.  This allows sheath fluid to be pulled up into the nozzle.
1.  Ensure that the nozzle tip is submerged into filtered sheath fluid in the nozzle purge reservoir.
1.  Close both the SAMPLE VALVE and the SHEATH VALVE, then open up the purge-valve.
1.  When the purge-valve is opened, bubbles (in the nozzle assembly) should be observed as they are pulled up through the nozzle.
1.  When all bubbles have traveled past the purge-valve, open the sheath-valve and then close the purge-valve. If necessary, add sheath fluid to the nozzle backflush reservoir to keep the tip submerged throughout this process.
1.  Remove the nozzle backflush reservoir and use a cotton swab or similar to remove excess fluid from the nozzle tip.
1.  Ensure that stream is emitted straight out of the nozzle tip.
    1.  If the stream is even slightly askew, return to the top of this subsection and repeat cleaning of the nozzle and flushing the system.
1.  Ensure that there are no bubbles in the system by closing the SHEATH VALVE.
    1.  If there are no bubbles, the stream should snap off quickly (less than one second).
    1.  If there are bubbles, the stream will take more time to stop (10-30sec).
        1.  This will require repeating this subsection.
1.  After testing for bubbles, reopen the SHEATH VALVE.


## 4.3.5 Align Stream

1.   Ensure that a corning tube is set in the well platform beneath the stream drain in the sort channel.
2.   **WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR SOFTWARE**

##### img "WDU Tray in PRESENT Position"

1.   Remove the flush bucket so that the stream passes through the illumination chamber into the sort chamber.
2.   Flip the ILLUM switch on the Control Panel to ON to illuminate the stream near the drain.
3.   The stream may or may not land in the stream drain but should be captured by the corning tube if it misses the stream drain.
     1.   If not, take extra precautions to ensure the stream is contained.
4.   Alignment of the stream consists of:
     1.   Bringing the stream into the focal point of the microscope objective.
     2.   Use the pinhole monitor and the sort stream nibutir for ordinary visual feedback while making adjustments to the stream.

1.   **(1) Bringing the stream into focus**
     1.   Use the x-axis (focus), y-axis (left-right), and z-axis (up-down) micrometers of the nozzle stage to focus and position the stream in the pinhole monitor as shown below.
     2.   The stream should be centered in the pinholes, sharply focused, and the nozzle tip should be barely visible at the top of the monitor.
     3.   It may be helpful to use the halogen lamp to illuminate the stream in the laser chamber for this procedure.
2.   **(2) Position Stream**
     1.   Once the stream is properly focused in the pinhole monitor, use the theta-angle and phi-angle micrometers of the nozzle stage to aim the stream at the drain in the sort stream monitor.
3.   Iterate between **(1)** and **(2)** until the stream is focused and positioned in the pinhole monitor and also aimed at the drain in the sort stream monitor.
