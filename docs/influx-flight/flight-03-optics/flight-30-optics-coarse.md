## Laser Alignment with Beer and Pinhole Camera

1.  Close the Laser Chamber Door and activate the Finger Switch to open Electronic Shutters (if using the 671 or new lasers)
    ::: note asset "Laser Chamber Door Shut"
    Laser Chamber Door is closed. Notice the finger switch and the Drop Camera Mirror is facing the correct direction.
    :::
2.  Open the Physical Laser Shutters by pulling the Hanldes (Left side of Instrument) out so that the red tape on the handle is visible outside the instrument panel.
    ::: note asset "Physical Laser Shutters pulled out and open"
    Laser Shutters on the left side of the instrument are open when the red tape is showing. The laser shutters are labeled with the corresponding laser.
    -   488 is second from the bottom
    -   457 is the bottom shutter
    :::
3.  Prepare a Sample Tube with 1ml Beer 
4.  Run the Beer Sample
5.  Use a flow rate of 30ul/min (as reported by Sensirion Software)
6.  Hold the BOOST button until the Sample Core becomes illuminated on the Pinhole Camera. 

### Beer Alignment

The goal here is to balance the Nozzle Assy Stage Y and Nozzle Assy Tilt Y such that:
1.  The illuminated Sample Core is a thin, well defined column for both the 488 and 457 lasers.
2.  The Lasers are vertically centered over the top (488nm) and third (457nm) Pinholes (Pinhole Camera)
3.  The Sample Stream is centered (both X and Y) over the Waste Pipe. 
    1.  As shown on the Sort Chamber “STREAM” Camera
    2.  Ensure the ILLUM light is On using the button on the Sort Control Panel. 
4.  Slight Adjustment of the Nozzle Assy Tilt Y in either direction has the same visual effect on sample core for both the 488nm and 457nm lasers.
5.  Sorting Note: The Sort Streams on the left and right side of the Waste Pipe are well illuminated.
6.  After alignment using the Pinhole Camera is complete, use the FSC Stage X/Y/Z to align to the FSC Camera
    1.  Use the toggle on the center monitor to set it to VIDEO 2
    2.  Ensure that the Sample Core illumination on the FSC Camera Monitor is well defined.
    2.  Center the illuminates spot over the FSC Pinhole (as seen on Camera).
