## Stage Directions

The various knobs on the InFlux provide increasingly fine levels of adjustment. In order from "Coarse" to "Finest" the knobs are:

1.  Stream Tilt X / Stream Tilt Y
    1.  Primarily used to align stream to waste pipe
2.  Stream Stage X / Stream Stage Y
    1.  Primary use: Align Stream to SSC/Fluor Detector Paths
3.  Laser Stage Vertical
    1.  Align Laser to SSC/Fluor Detectors
4.  FSC Lens X / FSC Lens Z
    1.  Align FSC Lens to 488 Laser in the vertical and horizontal planes perpendicular to the direction of laser light.
5.  FSC Lens Y 
    1.  "Focus" the FSC Lens to the 488 Laser
6.  Laser Stage Sweep
    1.  Fine adjustment of all lasers to the SSC/Fluor Detectors
    2.  Optional: Minor adjustments to FSC Lens 

## Alignment Procedure

-   Laser Stages and Tilt
-   Laser Systems Reference

## Alignment Pre-Flight

-   Laser Power
    -   Turn on 488
    -   Turn on 457
    -   (Optional) - Turn on 671
-   Systems Check
    -   Camera and Monitor check 
    -   Sortware check
    -   Laser power

## Visual Alignment

-   Tilt and Stage alignment via pinhole and stream cameras

## Coarse “Beer” Alignment

-   Laser alignment with beer and pinhole camera
-   FSC lens alignment with beer

## Final “Bead” alignment

-   Sortware Setup
-   Laser Alignment: 488nm to SSC/Fluorescence detectors 
-   Laser Alignment: 488nm to FSC
-   Laser Alignmwnt: 457nm to Fluorescence detextors
