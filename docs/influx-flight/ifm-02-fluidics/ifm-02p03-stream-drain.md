::: warning Before removing the Purge Drain
-   Be prepared advance directly to aligning the stream to the stream drain.
-   Ensure that there is a 50ml centrifuge tube in the sort tray stage and that it is centered below the waste pipe.
:::

### Preamble

1.  Remove Spoon and Drain from Instrument.
2.  Ensure the sample stream is exiting the sample stream port into the sort chamber.
    ::: note asset “Stream exiting laser chamber”
    It won’t be perfect centered.
    :::
    1.  The stream should be at least 1mm away from the port wall.
    2.  The sample stream will not be perfectly centered in the port once the instrument is completely aligned.
3.  Use a twisted KimWipe to soak up any water stuck to the Nozzle Tip
    ::: note asset “Drying nozzle with KimWipe
    Leaving that will interfere with alignment and sorting. Also, saline sheath fluid will leave salt deposits.
    :::
1.  Close the Sort Chamber Door (or otherwise satisfy the magnetic switch)
2.  Turn on the Stream Illumination laser with the ILLUM button on the instrument sort chamber control panel.
    ::: note asset “Sort chamber buttons”
    The PLATES and ILLUM buttons. Also show the plates warning
    :::
3.  The STREAM camera is mounted in the sort chamber, opposite the waste pipe and above the sort chamber door.
    4.  Spray from the stream being misaligned over the waste pipe can settle on the camera
    5.  If the Stream Camera is blurry, clean it off be gently dabbing with. Kim wipe.
    5.  The stream camera has a filter that is moved into place using the knob outside the instrument, above the sample chamber door.
    6.  Ensure that the filter is not covering the camera by using the knob to select the neutral camera filter on left.
    7.  If the filter is over the camera, it will block the red stream illumination laser
4.  From 


### Center Stream over Sheath Drain

::: note asset Stream start, not aligned
Example starting position.
:::

1.  Use the Stream Camera, Right Monitor, Video 1
2.  Use the Stream Tilt X and Stream Tilt Y Knobs at the top of the nozzle assembly stage.
3.  Adjust the stream until the laser interception point is brightest.
    1.  Laser X Tilt will be used to center the stream laterally over the waste tube
    2.  The laser Tilt Y will be used to optimize the bright spot.
    ::: note asset “Stream aligned to waste pipe”
    Stream aligned.
    :::
4.  Sorting Tip: 
    1.  The ILLUM laser fires from left to right in the sort chamber.
    2.  If you plan to sort, it may speed up your alignment to ensure that the ILLUM laser properly intersects both sort streams.
    3.  See the Sorting Setup for details on this process.
5.  Press BACKFLUSH Button next to the Sample Cradle to open the Sample Valve. 
    ::: note asset “Sample buttons and sample cradle ”
    Shown with back flush on. Both error lights are shown in the default (no error) state.
    :::
    1.  Sheath fluid should drip out of the Sample Tube
    2.  After 30 sec, if you do not hear the Sheath Fluid being sucked into the drain below the Sample Cradle (which leads to one of the four pink lines on the Waste Connector), check to verify that the drain is not clogged.
    3.  See the above if water begins to spill out because you ignored the previously given advice.
6.  Check Warning Lights below SAMPLE Button next to Sample Cradle.
