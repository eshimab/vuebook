## Yesterday: Prep Sheath

::: note Create the sheath fluid the day before
-   If Using BioSure or MilliQ for Sheath fluid, this is handy
-   If dissolving NaCl into MilliQ, it is **required.** 
-   See section on Sheath Prep.

## Run Day

### House Air

::: tip Always check the house air valve first!
-   The InFlux air pressure is provided by an air compressor in C-MORE's attic. 
-   If the building power flickers, the air compressor goes offline. 
-   **Only** UH Facilities have the key to the compressor room. 
-   We are checking the compressor first because, if it is off, the instrument can't be run until UH Facilities restarts the compressor.
:::

::: note asset "House Air Valve"
The House Air valve is under the lowest shelf on the bottom right corner of the bench opposite the instrument.
:::

1. Open the valve on the wall opposite the InFlux Chassis to access the building's air compressor (i.e. House Air).
    1. You should hear a *hiss* as the tubing pressurizes.
    2. If no air flows, then the compressor may be off. This often happens if the building loses power. If the compressor is off:
        1. Call UH Facilities at 1-808-956-7134 and tell them that they need to restart the building compressor at C-MORE.
        2. Tell them that this is impeding work and needs to be done asap.


### Fill Sheath Tank

::: note asset "Sheath Tank Prep Picture"
Picture of the graduated cylinder and/or salt and/or MilliQ.
:::

1. Use Graduated Cylinder to Mix Sheath Fluid
    1. For Non-Sorting, pure MilliQ Water is fine.
    2. For Sorting, we need a saline solution:
        1. For BioSure: Mixture is 1/8 BioSure Concentrate and 7/8 MilliQ Water in a Graduated Cylinder
        2. For NaCl: Dissolve **X** g NaCl in **Y** liters MillQ Water. *Let Sheath Fluid sit overnight to fully dissolve NaCl*
    3. Fill a 60ml Syringe with Sheath Fluid for Purging the instrument and filling sort tubes.
        1. Label Syringe.
        2. Attach a 0.2um Acrodisc Synring Filter to the synringe

### Syringes

::: note asset "Filled Syringes"
Three syringes filled with sheath fluid, MilliQ Water, and 70% ethanol.
:::

-   Sheath Syringe
    1.  Fill a 60ml Syringe with Sheath solution using the LuerLok Adapter.
        1.  Make sure the Sheath Tank is not sealed.
    2.  Attach a 0.2um Acrodisc filter. 
-   MilliQ Syringe
   1.  Fill a 60ml Syringe with MilliQ Water.
   2.  Attach a 0.2um Acrodisc filter.
-   (Sometimes Useful) 70% Ethanol
   1.  Fill a 60ml Syringe with 70% Ethanol.
   2.  Cap the Syringe. 
   3.  Ethanol will eat away at the Acrodisc filter. Install the filter only when necessary.
   

### Alignment Samples

::: note asset "Alignment Sample Tubes"
Filtered MilliQ, HB-` "Beer", 1.0um bead dilution, and (if sorting) 3.1um bead dilution.
:::

-   Filtered MilliQ
    -   From the MilliQ Syringe with 0.2um Filter
-   Coarse Alignment "Beer"
    1.  Fill a sample tube with about 800ul of "HB-1" Beer.
    2.  This is a dangerous lab chemical. Do not consume.
-   Laser Alignment 1.0um Calibration beads
    -   Create a dilution of 1.0um Ultra Rainbow Fluorescent Beads (*Spherotech*) by dropping 2-3 drops of Bead Concentrate into ~2ml 0.2um Filtered MilliQ Water
        -   Note: The 1.0um Bead concentration is **1E7**
-   (Sorting) 3.1um Calibration Beads
    -   Create a dilution of 1.0um Ultra Rainbow Fluorescent Beads (*Spherotech*) by dropping 5-6 drops of Bead Concentrate into ~2ml 0.2um Filtered MilliQ Water.
        -   Note: The 3.1um Bead concentration is **1E6** (lower than the 1.0 um)
