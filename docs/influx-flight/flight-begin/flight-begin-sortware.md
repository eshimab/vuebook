## Connect *Sortware* to Cytometer

::: warning Check Sort Chamber before connecting to Cytometer
-   Be sure that the Sort Chamber is free of any loose objects (beakers, syringes, etc) before Connecting Sortware to the Cytometer. 
-   When the cytometer connects to Sortware, the Sort Tray will perform a homing movement to center the tray.
-   Any objects which block the free movement of the Sort Tray aparatus will cause a mis-alignment between the coordinates in the Sortware Tray Control and the physical location of the sort tray.
:::

1.  Ensure that the Dell PC isn't making any error noises. 
2.  On the HP PC, click the *Sortware* icon in the menu bar on the top of the screen.
