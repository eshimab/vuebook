title: The Drop (Delay)
---


The Drop Delay is the time it takes for a particle to get from the trigger laser to the droplet at the tip of the jet. 

1.  The instrument applies a charge to the jet just before the target drop breaks off.
2.  The droplet keeps the charge after it separates from the jet.
3.  The Deflection Plates activate and pull the drop to the side of the sheath drain.
4.  We collect the drops in well-plates, sample tubes, and slides. 
    -   With the option to implement esoteric solutions.
