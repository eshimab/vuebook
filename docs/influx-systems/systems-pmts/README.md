# Systems PMTs RM

## FSC Detector 

1. Located at Front Right of Instrumenr
2. Directly across the Laser Chamber from where the Lasers enter the chamber. Lasers Enter from Left.

## Fluorescence and SSC Detectors

1. Detector Paths begin at the rear of the Laser Chamber
2. There are Five Pinholes, listed here from Top to Bottom *as they appear in the Pinhole Camera*. 
    1. Top: 488
    2. None
    3. Middle: 457
    4. None
    5. Bottom: 671
    6. *Note*: The Pinhole Camera image is vertically flipped: what looks like the top Pinhole (for the 488) is actually the bottom, and thus, the fluorescence detector path for the 488 Laser is on the bottom level of the fluorescence detector paths.
