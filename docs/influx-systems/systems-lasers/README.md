## Laser Chamber

1. Where the Lasers pass through the Sample Stream.
2. Laser Chamber Components
    1. Left: Laser Ingress
        1. Lasers enter the chamber from the Laser Intake Paths, after being directed using the Laser Stages (top of instrument, to left of Laser Chamber)
    2. Rear: Side-Scatter (SSC) and Fluorescence detector lens
        1. This lens is fixed and cannot be moved with a Stage.
    3. Right: Forward Scatter (FSC) Detector Lens
        1. This Lens can be moved using the FSC Lens Stage (located on Instrument Top, at right of Laser Chamber)
    4. Rear/Right Corner (between SSC and FSC lens): Cut-out for Drop Camera Mirror
    5. Front/Left Outside Laser Chamber: Drop Camera Mirror
        1.The Mirror has a peg on the bottom that fits into a slot outside the left edge of the Laser Chamber Door
        1. The Mirror should have the flat side angled towards the Drop Camera Cut-out
    6. Front: Laser Chamber Door
        1. There is a magnet switch that automatically closes the electric shutters on the Laser Shutters (at instrument far left)
        2. After opening the door (therefore closing the Electric Shutters), close the Laser Chamber Door, and place a finger over the Finger Switch (upper right corner of track where the Laser Chamber Door slides) to open the Electrix Shutters. 
        3. Note: The Electric Shutters can be forced open by closing and opening the Physical Laser Shutter Stops using the handles on Instrument Left Side.
        4. Further Note: The Electric Shutters for the 488nm and 457nm lasers have been **removed** because the Electroc Shutters were sticking and not re-opening when the Finger Switch was activated. The 488 and 457 lasers can only be shuttered using rhe Physical Laser Shutters.
    7. Bottom of Chamber below Nozzle Assembly: Port where the Stream enters the Sort Chamber below.
        1. During alignment, the combination of the Stream Stage and Stream Tilt may lead to the Stream not being centered in the port. That is okay.
    8. (*Optionla*) Top: Laser Chamber Cover
        1. For sensitive sorting, or if using UV Lasers
3. Shown on the Pinhole Camera
    1. The 5 Pinholes go to the fluorescence detector paths for each laser.
    2. From Top to Bottom the Pinholes are:
        1. Top: 488nm
        2. Empty
        3. Middle: 457nm
        4. Empty
        5. Bottom: 671nm

## Laser Intake Paths

1. Located on Left of Instrument
2. Physical Laser Shutters are located on the far left of the instrument, at the rear of the Laser Intake Path Panel.
    1. There are automatic Laser Shutters that close when the Laser Chamber door is open (unless the magnetic switch has been defeated).
    2. The automatic Shutters are re-opened when the Laser Chamber door is closed and the “Finger Switch” in the upper right corner of the Laser Chamber Door path has been activated (by hovering a finger over the sensor).
    3. The automatic shutters can also be opened by physically opening (or closing and reopening if the physical shutter was open) the Shutter Stops.
    4. The automatic Laser Shutters for the 488 and 457 lasers have been **removed** because they were sticking. The **only** way to block the 488 and 457 lasers is to close the Physical Shutter.
