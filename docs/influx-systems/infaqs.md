# Instrument Orientation

Section TLDR:
1. Instrument Left-Right-Front-Back and XYZ

## Stage Directions

1. The Right and Left sides of the instrument are based on the user facing the instrument from the front, viewing the Sort Chamber
2. In XYZ Terms we will use for Alignment Movements
    1. X = Machine Left-Right, with X Increasing from RIGHT to LEFT.
    2. Y = Machine Front-Back, with Y Increasing as you approach the Front of the Instrument.
    3. Z = Machine Up-Down, with Z increasing as you approach the top of the Instrument.

# Cameras and Marshal Monitor

1. Marshal Monitor is located on Computer Table.
2. Toggle Between the VIDEO 1 and VIDEO 2 Sources for each Monitor using the Silver Switch at the Upper Right Corner of the Monitor
3. Left Monitor "PIN HOLE"
    1. VIDEO 1 - Pinhole Camera of the Stream and the Laser Pinholes
    2. VIDEO 2 - None
4. Center Monitor  "DROP"
    1. VIDEO 1 - FSC Pinhole Camera 
        1. Camera is located on the FSC optical path
    2. VIDEO 2 - Drop Camera: For finding Break-off Point for Flow Sorting
        1. The Drop Camera is moved with the Drop Camera Z Knob located near the Sheath Valve on the top of the Instrument
        2. If the Drop Camera seems dark, be sure that the Drop Camera Mirror is installed outside the Laser Chamber with the Flat Side facing towards the corner between the FSC and Side/Fluorescence lenses. There is an opening in the wall of the Laser Chamber, allowing light from the Drop Camera Mirror to illuminate the stream viewed by the Drop Camera.
5. Right Monitor "STREAM"
    1. VIDEO 1 - Stream Camera (Shows Sort Chamber for Sorting and Coarse Alignment)
        1. If this Camera is dark, make sure to activate the yellow ILLUM Button located on the Front Right side of the Instrument Chassis
