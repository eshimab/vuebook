## 2.1.0 Run Day

::: tip Always check the house air valve first!
-   The InFlux air pressure is provided by an air compressor in C-MORE's attic. 
-   If the building power flickers, the air compressor goes offline. 
-   **Only** UH Facilities have the key to the compressor room. 
-   We are checking the compressor first because, if it is off, the instrument can't be run until UH Facilities restarts the compressor.

n the bottom right corner of the bench opposite the instrument.
:::

1. Open the valve on the wall opposite the InFlux Chassis to access the building's air compressor (i.e. House Air).
    1. You should hear a *hiss* as the tubing pressurizes.
    2. If no air flows, then the compressor may be off. This often happens if the building loses power. If the compressor is off:
        1. Call UH Facilities at 1-808-956-7134 and tell them that they need to restart the building compressor at C-MORE.
        2. Tell them that this is impeding work and needs to be done asap.
