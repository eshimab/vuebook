## 2.4.0 Visual Alignment with Pinhole Camera

Use the Stream Tilt X/Y and SSC/Fluor Stage X/Y knobs to visually align the stream with Pinhole and Stream Cameras.

Previously...
1.  Ensure that the Sort Chamber Light is on by pressing ILLUM Button on Instrument Chassis Front.
2.  Center Stream over Waste Tube (Stream Camera, Left Monitor, Video 1) using Stream Tilt X and Stream Tilt Y Knobs.

### 2.4.1 Pinhole Alignment

1.  Open Laser Chamber Door
3.  Set Nozzle Height via Pinhole and Drop Cameras
    1.  VIDEO to Channel 1 on the Left Monitor “PINHOLE”
4.  Move Nozzle Tip up to “Just Off Screen” of Pinhole Camera Monitor
5.  Set VIDEO to Channel 2 on the Center Monitor “DROP” to view the Drop Camera
6.  Move the Drop Camera Up using the Drop Camera Knob at Top of Instrument (to the Left of the Sheath and Waste Valves)
    1.  The Nozzle should be visible when the Drop Camera Readout (Below the Sheath Valve Control Buttons PULSE/PURGE/RINSE/RUN) is less than 40.
    2.  Move the Nozzle Tip using the Stream Stage Z Knob so that the Nozzle Tip is at the `<` symbol drawn on the Second Monitor. 
    3.  The Drop Camera Readout should be 38-41. 
7.  Bring the Sort Stream into focus on the Pinhole Camera.
    1.  The Stream should look fairly straight and have well defined sides once it is brought into focus
    2.  If there are visible twists in the Stream, remove the Nozzle and attempt to Flush it as described earlier.
