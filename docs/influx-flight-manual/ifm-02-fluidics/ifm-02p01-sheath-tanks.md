## Hook-Up Waste Canister

1.  Connect InFlux Waste Lines Intake
2.  Connect Vacuum Pump
    ::: note asset Waste tank / Vac Pump
    The waste tank connected to the vacuum pump.
    :::
    ::: note asset Vac Guard picture
    A properly installed Vacu-Guard filter.
    :::
    ::: warning Always use Vacu-Guard
    1.  Ensure that the vacuum pump to waste tank line has a properly installed Acrodisc Vent filter. 
    2.  The filter text should be on the Waste tank side of the vacuum pump line.
    3.  This filter prevents water from being sucked into the vacuum pump if **you** forget to empty the Waste tank.
    :::
3.  Turn on Vacuum Pump (Pump is powered by InFlux Instrument Power)
4.  Ensure that the House Air is valve is open and pressurized (see Lab Prep)

### Fill Sheath Tank

::: details asset "Sheath Tank Prep Picture"
Picture of the graduated cylinder and/or salt and/or MilliQ.
:::

1. Use Graduated Cylinder to Mix Sheath Fluid
    1. For Non-Sorting, pure MilliQ Water is fine.
    2. For Sorting, we need a saline solution:
        1. For BioSure: Mixture is 1/8 BioSure Concentrate and 7/8 MilliQ Water in a Graduated Cylinder
        2. For NaCl: Dissolve **32**g NaCl in **4** liters MillQ Water. *Let Sheath Fluid sit overnight to fully dissolve NaCl*
    3. Fill a 60ml Syringe with Sheath Fluid for Purging the instrument and filling sort tubes.
        1. Label Syringe.
        2. Attach a 0.2um Acrodisc Syringe Filter to the syringe

### Syringes

::: note asset "Filled Syringes"
Three syringes filled with sheath fluid, MilliQ Water, and 70% ethanol.
:::


1.  Sheath Syringe
    1.  Fill a 60ml Syringe with Sheath solution using the LuerLok Adapter.
       -   Make sure the Sheath Tank is not sealed.
    1.  Attach a 0.2um Acrodisc filter.
2. MilliQ Syringe
   1.  Fill a 60ml Syringe with MilliQ Water.
   2.  Attach a 0.2um Acrodisc filter.
3. 70% Ethanol (sometimes useful)
   1.  Fill a 60ml Syringe with 70% Ethanol.
   2.  Cap the Syringe. 
   3. Ethanol will eat away at the Acrodisc filter. Install the filter only when necessary.
   

::: note  "Alignment and Calibration Slides"
1. Filtered MilliQ
    - From the MilliQ Syringe with 0.2um Filter
2. Coarse Alignment "Beer"
    - Fill a sample tube with about 800ul of "HB-1" Beer.
    - This is a highly toxic lab chemical. Do not consume.
3. Laser Alignment 1.0um Calibration beads
    -   Create a dilution of 1.0um Ultra Rainbow Fluorescent Beads (*Spherotech*) by dropping 2-3 drops of Bead Concentrate into ~2ml 0.2um Filtered MilliQ Water
        -   Note: The 1.0um Bead concentration is **1E7**
4. Drop Delay 3.1um Calibration Beads
    -   Create a dilution of 1.0um Ultra Rainbow Fluorescent Beads (*Spherotech*) by dropping 5-6 drops of Bead Concentrate into ~2ml 0.2um Filtered Sheath or MilliQ Water.
        -   Note: The 3.1um Bead concentration is **1E6** (lower than the 1.0 um)
        -   Technically, using sheath fluid for the bead dilutions could be better because it maxes the indices of refraction of the sample and sheath solutions most similar. 
Filtered MilliQ, HB-` "Beer", 1.0um bead dilution, and (if sorting) 3.1um bead dilution.
