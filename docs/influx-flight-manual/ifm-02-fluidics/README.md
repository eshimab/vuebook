## 4.2.1 Power up Fluidics

### 4.2.1.1 Start Fluidics Early
- [ ] **Done**

- [ ] Fluids take from 30-60 minutes to fully stabilize. It is therefore important to start the fluidics as early as possible.

### 4.2.1.2 Close Valves
- [ ] **Done**

- [ ] Ensure all the valves are closed:
    - [ ]  Sample Valve
    - [ ]  Sheath Valve
    - [ ]  Purge Valve
    - [ ]  Sample Pressure Valve

### 4.2.1.3 Pressurize Sheath Reservoir
- [ ] **Done**

- [ ]  Close the pressure relief valve on the sheath reservoir.
- [ ]  Turn on air supply by flipping up the AIR toggle switch on the Pressure Console.
- [ ]  Observe the gauge on the sheath reservoir to ensure that it is being pressurized.
    - [ ]  Reseat the lid of the Sheath Res if the pressure on the Sheath Res does not increase.

### 4.2.1.4 Apply Vacuum
- [ ] **Done**

- [ ] Turn on the vacuum pump or other vacuum supply.
- [ ] Read the gauge of the waste reservoir and ensure that it reads at least 5” Hg. If less than 5” Hg is observed after the tank has a few moments to come to pressure, tighten the lid.
    - [ ]  It is necessary for the waste reservoir lid to be tightened as much as possible without the use of a wrench.
