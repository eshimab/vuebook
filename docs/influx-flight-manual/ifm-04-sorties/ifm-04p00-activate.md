## Pre-Flight Checklist

::: danger The Deflection Plates operate at over 3500 Volts.
Always ensure that the Deflection Plates are turned **OFF** via the PLATES button (the button will not be lit) on the Sort Chamber Control Panel before working in the Sort Chamber.
:::

::: note asset "Sort Chamber Control Panel Buttons with PLATES Off"
Safety third.
:::

1.  The Laser Chamber Door is closed. 
    -   There is a safety feature that prevents the Nozzle Assembly from applying the Piezo voltage while the laser chamber door is open.
    ::: danger Laser Chamber Door Sensor does NOT affect Deflection Plates.
    The Deflection Plates can only be turned on/off using the PLATES button.
    :::
2.  The Drop Camera is functional.
    1.  The drop camera mirror outside the laser chamber door is angled such that the flat side is pointed into the laser chamber, towards the drop camera cutout between the FSC and SSC lenses.
    2.  The Drop camera monitor, center monitor, is set to VIDEO 2. And the stream is visible on it.
    3.  The drop camera read-out on the regulator tower (just below the fluidics control buttons) is active.
3.  There is a 50ml centrifuge tube in the sort chamber tray to catch errant stream drops.
4.  The Sheath psi is set to 15.0 per the readout on the regulator tower.

## Clean Deflection Plates

:::: danger Be positive that the Deflection Plates are OFF!
Use the red PLATES button on the left side of the Sorr Chamber control panel. The button should **NOT** be lit.
  ::: note asset "Button Not Lit Up"
  If someone dies, it's not on us.
  :::
::::

1.  Open the sort chamber door
2.  Swing the deflection plates outward, away from the Waste tube.
    ::: note asset "Deflection Plates swung open"
    Try to get a vertical shot so the user can see how high up they need to clean.
    :::
3.  Use a KimWipe with 70% Ethanxol to gently clean the deflection plates. 
4.  Be sure to clean the inside and bottom of the deflection plates.
5.  Be sure to clean the entire plate. They are taller than they look.
6.  Dry the plates with a new KimWipe.
7.  Swing the deflection plates inwards towards the waste tube until they are held in place by the magnets.
    ::: note asset "Deflection Plates Closed"
    Almost ready to be almost ready.
    :::
8.  If necessary, gently clean the Sort chamber Camera.
    ::: note asset "Probably this "
    Not sure how to take this picture though...
